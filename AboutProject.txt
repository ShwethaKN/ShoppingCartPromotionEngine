I had an intention to create a web page with just the Checkout Cart functionality.
Hence create data in DB and models.But unfortunately due to my laptop issue kept the coding
to a Console app with Test application

CartData is a static class with mock data for 3 different scenarios mentioned in the problem statement.
Modify code line 19 in Main method of Program.cs to call methods for different scenarios.
scenario A - PrepareNoPromotionData()
scenario B - PreparePromotionData()
scenario C - PreparePromotionData2()

Test project have test cases for all 3 scenarios.
